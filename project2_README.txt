Electronic lock is a device built on BASYS2 FPGA board that takes 4 digit pass code as input to unlock.

Design an electronic combination lock. A four digit code can be entered by using the pushbuttons and slider switches. As the number is entered, it should be displayed on the sevensegment display. The number is entered as follows. Slider switches 3 through 0 should be used to enter the binary value to be displayed on a particular digit of the seven-segment display. Slider switch 3 corresponds to the most significant bit and slider switch 0 the least significant bit. When a momentary push button is pressed the number represented on the slider switches should be latched and displayed on the corresponding digit on the seven-segment display. After the number has been entered, the user should move switch 4 from the low position to the high position, and then back to the low position to indicate that the code entering is complete. When the correct combination is entered and the device unlocks, the LEDs will flash. If two attempts are made to unlock the device without correctly entering the combination, the device should be deactivated for 20 seconds. The seven segment display will be used to display the state of the lock. The states are: LOC (locked), UnLC (unlocked), and PAUS (deactivated). When the device is unlocked, it can be locked by moving DIP switch 5 from the low to the high position, and then back to the low position. The entire code must be entered within 30 seconds (from the first button press to the last button press). The combination for your lock would be 5982.
